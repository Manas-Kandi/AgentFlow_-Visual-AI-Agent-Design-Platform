# Rule: AgentFlow Product & Market Context
## Applies to: Documentation, comments, product decisions, UI copy
## Activation: Always

### Intent
Align all development with AgentFlow's market position and value proposition.

### Problem We're Solving
- **Current State**: Designers use Figma/Miro for agent design (square peg, round hole)
- **Market Signal**: 51% of Figma AI users now build agents (vs 21% last year)
- **Gap**: No design tool understands autonomous behavior, conditions, or AI reasoning
- **Opportunity**: $17B â†’ $49B conversational AI market by 2031

### What Makes AgentFlow Different
1. **Behavior-First Design** - Model decisions and reasoning, not screens
2. **Live AI Testing** - Real Gemini responses during design phase
3. **Visual Programming** - Complex logic without code
4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Design agent teams visually
5. **Developer Handoff** - Generate implementation specs

### Technical Differentiators
- **Modular Node System**: Extensible, type-safe architecture
- **Real-time Execution**: See flows run with actual AI
- **State Management**: Handle complex, stateful conversations
- **Visual Debugging**: Understand agent decision-making
- **Export Ready**: (Future) Generate code from visual flows

### Target Users & Use Cases
**Primary**: Product designers transitioning to AI
- Building customer service agents
- Designing conversational experiences
- Creating multi-step AI workflows

**Secondary**: Developers prototyping agent logic
- Rapid agent behavior iteration
- Visual debugging of complex flows
- Team collaboration on agent design

### Communication Tone
- **Confident**: "The design tool built for the agentic era"
- **Clear**: Avoid AI hype, focus on concrete capabilities
- **Practical**: Show real use cases, not theoretical possibilities
- **Urgent**: The market is moving fast, we're the solution
